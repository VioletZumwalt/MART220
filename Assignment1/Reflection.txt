Reflection on the AI coding...

Incredibly funny. This is about what I expected from AI coding. 
The file took 3 refreshes before it spat something that actually functioned, which is also a great sign.
It sure is the colors of them, but the shapes do not reference each other in location, so that's how we get a mallard back instead of a salad.
It looks like a mallard with a green beak. 
AI is not AI right now. It's just spitting back associations. It doesn't truly create anything.
This is not something that could viably replace people, and yet, people are losing jobs to it.
I believe that, if done with sense, AI can be a good reference for explaining how code one wrote works.
It cannot do the work for you.
You cannot even trust it'll be correct in telling you how code works.
