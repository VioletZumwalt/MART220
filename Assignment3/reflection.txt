Image webpage : https://pixai.art

I used that webpage because I have heard things about it before. It is mostly well off, though one ai cat had a tail that wasn't its own wrapped around its neck
Quick prompting with simple wants, and that worked out well. It shows a lot how it knows assocations, but does NOT know how to keep it clean.
I told it realism and it gave me highly rendered drawing, so it wasn't great at following its instructions anyhow. 
Sad that people use AI to step in for actual art.
